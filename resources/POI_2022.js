However, like many dams built at the turn of the century, this structure has not been kind to spawning salmon. Growing concern over the salmon population in the White River has led the US Army Corps to undertake the construction of a \u003ca href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toW5w7vF3gA&ab_channel=U.S.ArmyCorpsofEngineers%2CSeattleDistrict\"\u003etrap and haul facility\u003c/a\u003e at the dam site. When completed, the facility will allow returning fish to be captured at the diversion dam and transported 6 miles upstream to continue their journey.

Water from the lake is still routed beneath the powerhouse to rejoin the White River near Sumner, but the twin turbines no longer spin","Description2":"."}},{"type":"Feature","id":4,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.18390299399999,47.246974672000078]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":4,"OBJECTID_1":5,"OBJECTID_12":5,"Name":"Gobel's Arm Trestle","Image":"","Caption":"","Description":"For a time after the reservoir was filled, this trestle remained visible above the water’s surface. In 2022, this is no longer the case, but a significant portion of the trestle remains, hidden beneath the waves. The typical water level of the reservoir is so far above it that it remains virtually invisible to the thousands of summer visitors floating overhead. Only in record years, when the lake has been at its lowest extent, has the trestle been visible, if only briefly","Description2":"."}},{"type":"Feature","id":5,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.19722512399994,47.239797043000067]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":5,"OBJECTID_1":6,"OBJECTID_12":6,"Name":"Covered Flume","Image":"https://i.imgur.com/1iZIO1t.png","Caption":"Above photo taken Dec, 2022.

However, when the reservoir is full, the flume remains submerged beneath several dozen feet of water. Given the depth of the channel west of this point, and the inherent risks surrounding the outlet tunnel, this area of the lake is closed to the public. In past winters, when the water level of the reservoir is significantly reduced, the flume has become briefly visible for several months before sinking back beneath the water’s surface, hidden once more","Description2":"."}},{"type":"Feature","id":6,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.18975595799998,47.240472077000049]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":6,"OBJECTID_1":8,"OBJECTID_12":9,"Name":"Sawmill","Image":"","Caption":"","Description":"Very little remains of the Lake Tapps Sawmill. The secluded arm of the lake where it once stood is now popularly referred to as “Party Cove” and is a popular destination for the lake’s summer visitors.

This is mostly because the tunnel infrastructure is still used to draw water out of the reservoir and route it down the hill to rejoin the White River.

However, the concrete canal still meets this junction point, several miles outside of Buckley, amidst sprawling pastures. From here, the gates open to allow the water into a covered flume, which carries it underground until reaching Printz Basin","Description2":"."}},{"type":"Feature","id":9,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.17806882799999,47.24929489200008]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":9,"OBJECTID_1":11,"OBJECTID_12":12,"Name":"Embankment no.3","Image":"","Caption":"","Description":"Embankment no. 3, along with the other 12 dikes created during the project, remains in place. It is one of 8 dikes immediately surrounding North Lake Tapps Park, preventing a torrent of water from rushing into the forest beyond. For this reason, it is constantly maintained and is now coated in a layer of stone. The railroad that used to pass alongside it has been replaced with 9th Street East, the most popular driving route around the north end of the lake","Description2":"."}},{"type":"Feature","id":10,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.02391327899994,47.171658314000069]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":10,"OBJECTID_1":12,"OBJECTID_12":13,"Name":"Wolslagle Basin","Image":"https://i.imgur.com/GG0Hpp7.png","Caption":"Above photo taken Dec, 2022.

However, the basin is now crossed by the heavily traveled Highway 410 as the road carries drivers to Enumclaw and beyond into the Cascades.
